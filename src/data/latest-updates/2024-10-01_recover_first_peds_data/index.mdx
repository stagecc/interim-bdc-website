For the first time, data from pediatric participants in the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative are being made available to the public and research community. The dataset, released in BDC on September 30, 2024, contains survey and laboratory results from more than 24,000 young adults, children, infants, and their caregivers who participated in more than 62,000 study visits at 115 enrolling sites across the country between March 17, 2022, and June 15, 2024.

This new data adds to the RECOVER adult observational cohort study data already released into BDC, which included data collected between October 29, 2021, and March 15, 2024, from over 15,000 adult participants (including a sub-cohort of over 2,000 pregnant women) who participated in over 122,000 study visits at 79 enrolling sites around the country. 

Anyone can search the RECOVER data in BDC using a publicly available query tool (aggregate counts returned), and authorized researchers can request access to analyze de-identified individual participant data. RECOVER observational cohort data are only available via a controlled-access process requiring investigators to have [NIH Electronic Research Administration (eRA) Commons](https://public.era.nih.gov/commonsplus/public/login.era?TARGET=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.era.nih.gov%3A443%2Fcommons) credentials and receive data access permissions through the Data Access Request (DAR) process of the [NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/). This process protects study participant privacy while creating more opportunities for data analysis and scientific discoveries.

Sharing this RECOVER data in BDC means that authorized researchers can not only access these datasets in secure workspaces but can also use BDCâ€™s analytic tools, applications, and workflows. [BDC hosts many other datasets](/resources/data/), including those from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, several sickle cell disease studies, and other COVID research.
