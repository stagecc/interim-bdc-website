### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/8017241872334/WN_GjMhxs7rQNOyQWZgiygS8w) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](/join-bdc/).

Make sure to [register now](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/8017241872334/WN_GjMhxs7rQNOyQWZgiygS8w) - we look forward to seeing you!
