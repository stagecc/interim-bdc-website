Allison Gillaspy, PhD will introduce the hour by presenting an overview for the NHLBI Blood division interest in Sickle Cell research and will briefly mention some of the currently funded studies. She will also introduce the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative and provide information about that program.

We will then hear from Tabitha Hendershot, PhD as she leads us on a Deep Dive into the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium Registry. Helen Pan and Emily Hughes will investigate research questions and demonstrate responses into the BDC hosted Sickle Cell data on BDC. Finally, we will hear about emerging research in Sickle Cell and Hispanic populations from clinical researcher Priya Parikh, MD.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/8017241872334/WN_GjMhxs7rQNOyQWZgiygS8w) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](/join-bdc/).
