  title: "November Community Hours: Professor Susan Redline discusses Sleep Data coming to BDC"
  description:
---
Professor Redline will discuss a recently published paper in SLEEP: The National Sleep Research Resource: making data findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable and promoting sleep science. In discussing the article, she will touch on the scope of data within the NSRR, its role in promoting sleep and circadian research through data sharing, and harmonization of large datasets and analytical tools and opportunities for approaches for the field of sleep medicine to further support data standardization and sharing.

Professor Susan Redline is the Peter C. Farrell Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. She is also a co-founder of The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR; www.sleepdata.org), an NHLBI-funded data repository and community resource that shares large quantities of polysomnography, actigraphy and other sleep and circadian data coupled with tools that offer guidance for structuring, harmonizing, visualizing and analyzing sleepdata. NSRR data is in the process of being made available on BDC.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/8217243503385/WN_ewp2GHGGSpa36vwASC1xyQ) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](/join-bdc/).
