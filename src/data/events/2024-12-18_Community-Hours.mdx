  title: "BDC December Community Hours: Reflect on 2024 and NIMHD's ScHARE"
  description:
---
This event presents analyses which jointly use NIMHD's ScHARE and BDC hosted datasets to answer two research questions.

First, we will use the NHLBI TOPMed: Whole Genome Sequencing of Venous Thromboembolism (WGS of VTE) dataset (dbGaP Study Accession: phs001402.v3.p1) to investigate gene-environment interaction between state-level social determinants of health on the age-of-onset of Venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Second, we will perform a re-analysis of the COVID-19 Outpatient Thrombosis Prevention Trial (ACTIV-4B) (dbGaP Study Accession: phs002710.v1.p1) to determine if social determinants of health play a role in preventing thrombotic events in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Plus, Regina Bures, PhD, serves as the Scientific Program Director for NHLBI's BDC and NHLBI's Data Science Strategist. In this video, Dr. Bures reflects on BDC in 2024 and looks forward to 2025.

### What are Community Hours?

BDC Community Hours is a monthly, hour-long event where users can learn about features of the ecosystem. The hour is split into time for presentation by a platform team and time for questions. Teams will showcase tools, new features, or tips that meet user needs. After the presentations, time is available for discussion and questions for platform reps from users.

Even if you cannot attend the session live, you can still [register](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/7717308947961/WN_7IbjYTTvT5aMC4YCggmCCQ) to have the session recording and slides sent to you post-event.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to BDC or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, we welcome you to [join our community](/join-bdc/).

Make sure to [register now](https://renci.zoom.us/webinar/register/7717308947961/WN_7IbjYTTvT5aMC4YCggmCCQ) - we look forward to seeing you!
