The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the RECOVER Initiative invite scientists and researchers to join a two-part webinar series to learn more about accessing and using RECOVER data to continue advancing our understanding of Long COVID.
 
RECOVER has made 48 million datapoints and 1.4 million biosamples from study participants available to authorized researchers. These data are available because of the contributions of the nearly 30,000 adults and children who participated in RECOVER observational studies and the NIH’s commitment to data availability.
 
This commitment to sharing RECOVER data with scientific communities creates independent opportunities to investigate Long COVID and ensures results from RECOVER studies can be reproduced.
 
During our webinars, you will learn about:
- The value of using RECOVER's vast repository of data and biosamples in your studies—data which is nationally reflective of the people and communities affected by COVID
- The types of data collected through RECOVER observational studies
- How to explore and analyze RECOVER data on NHLBI BioData Catalyst®, a cloud-based ecosystem that offers researchers data, analytic tools, applications, and workflows in secure workspaces
- Current RECOVER research opportunities available to scientists, including [funded ancillary pathobiology studies](https://recovercovid.org/funding#current)
 
 Part 1 of the webinar series—to be held Tuesday, December 9—will focus on accessing and using RECOVER observational study datapoints, such as data collected from study visits and symptom surveys. *Learn about [Part 1: Using RECOVER data to advance your research](/events/2025-12-09/recover-webinar-part-one).*
 
Part 2 of the webinar series—to be held Tuesday, January 13—will focus on accessing and using biosamples from RECOVER observational studies in ancillary studies.
