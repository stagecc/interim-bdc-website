The American Heart Association and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute are co-hosting a webinar on Sept 11, 2025, from 1-2pm ET. The session will help researchers learn how to access data and cloud-based workspaces to support their research and grant applications. We will highlight two such tools - the Precision Medicine Platform and NHLBI BioData CatalystÂ®, as well as hear directly from researchers experienced in both.
