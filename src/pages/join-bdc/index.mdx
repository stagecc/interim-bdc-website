  Researchers and others interested in BDC are encouraged to join the community.
  Members receive two important things:
  
  - Emails with information about ecosystem developments, data going into BDC,
    research resulting from BDC use, and events supporting BDC users.
  - The ability to interact (not just search and read) in
    BDC's [Forums](https://bdcatalyst.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/60000024585).
  
  *NOTE: Joining the BDC Community is not the same as getting an eRA Commons account.
  Where login is required in BDC (e.g., Analyze Data), people must use their eRA Commons
  credentials. Visit the [eRA Commons website for more information](https://www.era.nih.gov/register-accounts/create-and-edit-an-account.htm)
  about creating and managing an eRA Commons account.*
