## Data Use Policy Statement

BDC adheres to internationally recognized policies for data access and release developed to enable broad access to data on the BDC ecosystem. Data on the BDC ecosystem are subject to general and data-set-specific data use policies, and access to controlled data is restricted to authorized users. Each BDC user is solely responsible for adhering to Data Use Agreement(s), Institutional Review Board policies and guidelines, and other Data Use Limitations when uploading, importing, or downloading data on the BDC ecosystem.

Whether working with hosted or their own data, BDC users are obligated to protect participant privacy and follow NIH data protection policies. User institutions are accountable and may be subject to sanctions if policies are violated.

## Hosted Data Access Controls

All hosted data within BDC is de-identified. 

### Authorization of Use

Access to hosted data is controlled through the [Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (dbGaP) system by authorization of the appropriate Data Access Committee (DAC). Data Access Committees are established based on programmatic areas of interest as well as technical and ethical expertise. All DACs operate through common principles and under similar mechanisms to ensure the consistency and transparency of the controlled data access process. Use of industry-standard [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/) and [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC) services, which are connected to [NIHâ€™s electronic Research Administration](https://era.nih.gov/) (eRA) infrastructure for authentication and authorization, ensures that only data objects approved for access by NIH DACs and approved in dbGaP are available to a user in BDC.

### Access to Individual Level Data and Download Functionality

All data transfers are made using standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted sessions, and users must be logged in with their eRA accounts to access individual-level data or download any data (see below for details about downloading data).

### Data Download Restrictions

Download capabilities are limited to metadata and analysis results, and the latter must comply with restrictions defined by NIH for [Summary Results](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-19-023.html). Downloading sequences, variants, images, phenotypes, and other individual data is prohibited. BDC notifies and repeatedly reminds users that they may not download individual-level data, including when they receive cloud credits, login, and request downloads. Monitoring of data egress adds another layer of security.

## Citing and Acknowledging BDC

BDC users are expected to cite ecosystem usage. They will mention its utilization and how BDC contributed to their work in the main sections of their resulting research publications and external presentations. NHLBI BDC Pilot Funding Program and Cloud Credit Support Program recipients also agree to acknowledge the funding in all publications and external presentations resulting from that work. The standard [BDC Citation and Acknowledgement language](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/community/citation-and-acknowledgement) is available in BDC documentation.
