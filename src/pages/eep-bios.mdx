## Alexander Bick
Alexander Bick is a physician-scientist working in the field of human genomics. He is an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University in the Division of Genetic Medicine. His scientific observations have advanced our understanding of the genetic basis for cardiovascular disease, characterized molecular disease mechanisms, and identified both the promise and limitations of translating genomic findings into routine medical practice. Dr. Bick's current scientific focus is on clonal hematopoiesis, a unifying feature of aging diseases as diverse as cardiovascular disease and cancer. He seeks to understand how the interplay between inherited germline genetic factors and acquired somatic mutations contributes to disease.

## Harrison Brand
Harrison Brand's scientific career has included a diverse set of research pursuits that have reflected a natural evolution towards his ultimate goal of understanding how genetic variation contributes to complex disease. After completion of his PhD in Human Genetics, he accepted a postdoc position in the lab of Dr. Michael Talkowski at the Center for Genomic Medicine at MGH investigating the impact of structural variation (SV) on developmental disorders. Upon completion of his postdoc, Dr. Brand accepted a junior faculty position in the Department of Neurology at MGH, where he continues to evaluate the impact of SV on disease.

## Stephanie Cook
Dr. Stephanie Cook is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Biostatistics and Social and Behavioral Sciences at New York Universityâ€™s College of Global Public Health. Dr. Cook's research interests center on understanding how daily (e.g., microaggressions, financial stress) and global (e.g., childhood adversity, poverty) stressors influence cardiovascular disease risk. Overall, Dr. Cook hopes to inform the development of interventions that reduce the impact of stress on long-term cardiovascular health, especially for racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations.
