## Overview
NHLBI BioData Catalyst® (BDC) is a cloud-based ecosystem offering researchers analytical tools, applications, and workflows in secure workspaces where researchers can find, access, share, store, and compute on hosted data or data they bring to it. BDC is also an NHLBI data repository where researchers share scientific data so they and others can reproduce findings and reuse data to advance science. The TOPMed Imputation Server, where researchers can upload their own phased or unphased GWAS genotypes and receive phased and imputed genomes in return, is also part of the BDC ecosystem.

By increasing access to data and innovative analytic capabilities, BDC accelerates biomedical research to drive scientific advances that can help prevent, diagnose, and treat heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders.

## The BDC Community

BDC welcomes and supports investigators conducting research, preparing and submitting scientific data resulting from their research, or both. BDC is both an ecosystem and a research community where users help each other and are encouraged to [contribute user resources](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/community/contributing-user-resources-to-bdc) and leverage the resources others contribute. **Users of BDC must abide by the [BDC Terms of Use and Policies, comply with data protection requirements and other policies](/user-resources/usage-terms), uphold the BDC Statement of Conduct (see below), and [cite and/or acknowledge BDC](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/community/citation-and-acknowledgement) appropriately.**

BDC encourages researchers and others interested in NHLBI data science activities to join the community to stay up to date on ecosystem developments, data going into BDC, research resulting from BDC use, and events that support BDC users.

### Statement of Conduct

The BioData Catalyst Consortium is dedicated to **providing a harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of gender, gender identity, and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any venue, including meetings, presentations, or discussions.

### Focus on Users

Current and potential users of the ecosystem and others are encouraged to provide their input by going to the [Contact Us](/help-support/contact) webpage and selecting the “Provide Feedback” type (dropdown option). User feedback weighs heavily into the decisions about enhancements to the ecosystem.

User and community feedback received since BDC's inception has led to the incorporation of different functionalities and improvements in the way BDC provides user support. In its early stages, NHLBI and ecosystem developers depended on input from an External Expert Panel and initial users. In 2020, NHLBI ensured the receipt of more valuable insights by supporting [three cohorts of fellowships over three years. NHLBI funded over 45 early-career researchers](/about/bdc-fellows) in researching novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems while benefiting from their feedback on improving BDC and its users' experiences.

Today, BDC still welcomes feedback from participants in [Fellowship Collaborations](/about/key-collaborations) and encourages all users and potential users to provide input to help in our effort to meet users’ needs.

## BDC Infrastructure

The [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), a part of the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/), funds two BDC infrastructural components that collaboratively work to support the BDC ecosystem:

> The **BioData Catalyst Coordinating Center ([Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI)](https://renci.org/) at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill)** manages operations within the BDC developer consortium and ensures the ecosystem grows in alignment with NHLBI’s strategic vision. Under the direction of NHLBI, the BioData Catalyst Coordinating Center oversees program facilitation and management, technical planning, communication, user experience, work plan coordination, and project monitoring and control. [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/) is a partner on the BioData Catalyst Coordinating Center and contributes to successful collaboration between BDC3, NHLBI, and the BDC consortium.

> The **BDC Data Management Core (DMC) ([Renaissance Triangle Institute](https://www.rti.org/))** supports the ingestion of heart, lung, blood, and sleep data into BDC to facilitate its availability for reuse by the researcher community. It is responsible for streamlining processes for data ingestion into the ecosystem, aiming to facilitate efficient data integration through the development of procedures and tools related to standards and data harmonization.

## BDC Consortium

The BDC ecosystem integrates services to facilitate researchers’ ability to find, access, share, store, and compute on datasets. BDC prioritizes interoperability, compatibility, portability, and usability of platforms and services to address the variety of research methods and myriad user needs.

**The following is a list of BDC's current consortium members:**

- [Gen3](https://gen3.org/) manages data and metadata for BDC-hosted data, authenticates and authorizes users, allows users to conduct lexical searches, and provides dynamic cohort building with the ability to export to computational analysis platforms.
- [Dug](https://github.com/helxplatform/dug) performs full-text searches using ontologies and controlled vocabularies to discover connections between elements of datasets to allow users to identify phenotypic concepts and study variables.
- [PIC-SURE](https://pic-sure.org/) combines genetic, environmental, imaging, behavioral, and clinical data on individual patients from multiple sources into integrated sets. PIC-SURE Authorized Access* enables users to search clinical data and genomic variants, conduct feasibility queries, build cohorts in real time, and import results to BDC workspaces for analysis. PIC-SURE Open Access enables users to search clinical data without requiring a login to conduct feasibility queries returning aggregate counts.
- [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) ([Velsera](https://velsera.com/))* provides secure, collaborative workspaces for analyzing data using hundreds of optimized Common Workflow Language analysis tools and workflows, as well as Jupyterlab, RStudio, and SAS for interactive analysis. The platform offers researchers the ability to perform common analyses of genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics data, including association testing and single-cell analysis. The Annotation Explorer and GENESIS workflows support rare variant association testing.

\* Indicates that BDC users must have eRA Commons credentials. See the "Requirements for Accessing BDC Hosted Data" section on the [Explore Data in BDC webpage](/use-bdc/explore-data).

While it is not the primary analysis platform in BDC, users may opt to use Terra as an analysis platform. For more information about the differences between BDC's standard workspaces and those provided by BDC Powered by Terra, visit this webpage.

## BDC History

- 2016: NHLBI published an [NHLBI Strategic Vision](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/strategic-vision), which included among its objectives "leveraging emerging opportunities in data science to open new frontiers in heart, lung, blood, and sleep research."

- 2018: NHLBI launches what is now known as NHLBI BioData Catalyst® (BDC), adding to its growing portfolio of data science activities. Early on, BDC recognized the importance of gathering external experts and formed the External Expert Panel (EEP).

- 2019: BDC formally adopted its name and aligned its branding to NHLBI, making it recognizable as an Institute project and elevating its visibility among the research community.

- 2020: BDC welcomed its first and second of three total cohorts of fellows to the NHLBI BioData Catalyst Fellows Program. BDC supported over 45 early-career researchers conducting research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems while also benefiting from their feedback on improving the ecosystem and its users' experience.

- 2021: BDC welcomed all researchers [by inviting them to join the community](/latest-updates/NHLBI-BioData-Catalyst-welcomes-all-researchers) and use the ecosystem to access and analyze data. First among the data hosted by BDC was [NHLBI's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/), which included data from over 85 studies and around 180,000 participants. In this same year, BDC also graduated its third cohort of fellows.

- 2022: NHLBI expanded the BDC infrastructure by adding the BDC Data Management Core to help ingest data and offer informational resources about using BDC as a data repository.

- 2023: [NIH's Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html) went into effect on January 25th, and on May 25th, the [NHLBI Supplement to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/nhlbi-policy-for-data-sharing) went into effect. The Supplement "encourages submission of data into [NHLBI BioData Catalyst (BDC)](/), especially for data from studies that must comply with [NHLBI's Accrual of Human Subjects (Milestones) Policy](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/accrual-of-human-subjects-milestones-policy) and for those projects supported by funding opportunity announcements that encourage data deposition into BDC. NHLBI also encourages the submission of data into BDC for NHLBI projects and ancillary studies to NHLBI parent studies subject to the NIH GDS Policy."
