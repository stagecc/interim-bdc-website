The NHLBI BDC Fellows Program provided early-career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and others) funding for heart, lung, blood, and sleep research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems. 

The **three cohorts of fellows, totaling over 45 investigators**, were among the first users of the ecosystem. As a result, BDC Fellows provided valuable feedback that informed the development of the ecosystem while also advancing research that has resulted in the publication of multiple manuscripts. Numerous fellows continue using BDC for their research, and many have become champions of BDC's value to the research community.

*The BDC Fellows Program began in March 2020 and ended in February 2022. The biographical information and research project details on this webpage are from that time.*

Since the conclusion of the NHLBI BDC Fellows Program in 2022, BDC has continued engaging fellows through Fellowship Collaborations. Read more about these collaborations on the [Key Collaborations webpage](/about/key-collaborations).
