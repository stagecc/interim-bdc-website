The NHLBI BDC Fellows Program provided early-career researchers (graduate students, postdocs, 
junior faculty, and others) funding for heart, lung, blood, and sleep research on novel and 
innovative data science and data-focused research problems. 

The **three cohorts of fellows, totaling over 45 investigators**, were among the first users of the 
ecosystem. As a result, BDC Fellows provided valuable feedback that informed the development of the 
ecosystem while also advancing research that has resulted in the publication of multiple 
manuscripts. Numerous fellows continue using BDC for their research, and many have become champions 
of BDC's value to the research community.

*The BDC Fellows Program began in March 2020 and ended in February 2022. The biographical 
information and research project details on this webpage are from that time.*

Since the conclusion of the NHLBI BDC Fellows Program in 2022, BDC has continued engaging fellows through Fellowship Collaborations. Read more about these collaborations on the Key Collaborations webpage.
