# Research Communities

BDC collaborates with many of NHLBI's largest research communities by ingesting their data, integrating their resources (as appropriate), and providing their research communities with analytical tools, applications, workflows, and secure workspaces where they compute data from their programs as well as other BDC-hosted data. As part of these collaborations, BDC identifies, develops, and deploys ecosystem enhancements needed to meet the communities' needs and tailors the onboarding of researchers in these communities to help them join the BDC community.

## TOPMed @BDC

The first of BDC's research community collaborations was with the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, whose leaders and members provided vital input from BDC's earliest stages to today.

[Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/) is a program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a part of the National Institutes of Health, which aims to improve scientific understanding of the [fundamental biological processes ](https://topmeddemo.wesdemo.com/about#pills-tab)that underlie heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders and advance precision medicine in ways that lead to disease treatments tailored to individuals' unique genes and environments.

TOPMed supports these scientific advances through the integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other omics data (e.g., metabolic profiles, epigenomics, protein, and RNA expression patterns) with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data from pre-existing parent studies that have large samples of human subjects with rich phenotypic characterization and environmental exposure data. TOPMed also collects environmental and behavioral data, such as dietary habits, physical activity, and socioeconomic factors, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to these disorders.

TOPMed genomic data and parent study phenotypic data are controlled-access data, meaning they are available to researchers who have eRA Commons IDs and who applied for and received data access permissions through the Data Access Request (DAR) process of the NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

## BioLINCC @BDC

The mission of [BioLINCC](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/) is to facilitate access to and maximize the scientific value of the Biorepository and Data Repository and promote the availability and use of other NHLBI-funded population-based biospecimen and data resources. Study datasets and/or biospecimens from numerous clinical and epidemiological studies are available as Open Period collections.

All BioLINCC data and biospecimen are de-identified (obvious subject identifiers have been redacted); however, they contain such a wealth of individual data that there may be a possibility of determining identity. Therefore, BioLINCC operates under an NIH IRB-reviewed protocol, which requires that datasets may only be released to researchers who are themselves under the oversight of an IRB. In BioLINCC, most of the studies have datasets only; some have both study datasets and biospecimens, and others have biospecimens with limited vial characterization data but not complete study datasets.

BDC has ingested some of BioLINCC's data and is working closely with BioLINCC to continue ingesting more BioLINCC data regularly. BioLINCC data are controlled-access data, which means they are available to researchers who have eRA Commons IDs and received data access permissions through the Data Access Request (DAR) process of the NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

## Cure Sickle Cell Initiative 

The [Cure Sickle Cell Initiative](https://curesickle.org/) was launched in September 2018 by the NHLBI and aims to transform the lives of individuals living with SCD by moving the most promising genetic therapies safely into clinical trials. This collaborative, patient-focused research effort actively engages the sickle cell disease (SCD) community -- patients, advocates, caregivers, providers, researchers, industry, and others  --  and explores the scientific questions needed to safely and effectively advance potential therapies.

BDC has ingested some of the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative's data and is working closely with the Initiative to continue ingesting more data regularly. Cure Sickle Cell Initiative data are controlled-access data, meaning they are available to researchers who have eRA Commons IDs and received data access permissions through the Data Access Request (DAR) process of the NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

## HeartShare

[HeartShare](https://amphf.org/) is an NHLBI-funded program to conduct large-scale analysis of phenotypic data, images, and omics from patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and controls to characterize disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.

HeartShare is comprised of retrospective and prospective components. HeartShare aggregates and harmonizes data from previously completed cohort studies and trials, including images and omics analyses. Prospective data are generated from the HeartShare registry of up to 10,000 participants and deep phenotyping study cohorts involving up to 2,000 participants.  Both cohorts will have baseline and longitudinal data.

BDC has ingested some of HeartShare's data and is working closely with the HeartShare Data Translation Center to continue ingesting more HeartShare data regularly. HeartShare data are controlled-access data, meaning they are available to researchers who have eRA Commons IDs and received data access permissions through the Data Access Request (DAR) process of the NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

## National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) 

[NSRR](https://sleepdata.org/) is an NHLBI-supported repository for sharing large amounts of sleep data (polysomnography, actigraphy, and questionnaire-based) from multiple cohorts, clinical trials, and other data sources. Launched in April 2014, the mission of the NSRR is to advance sleep and circadian science by supporting secondary data analysis, algorithmic development, and signal processing by sharing high-quality datasets. The NSRR encourages active engagement by the sleep and circadian communities, aiming to expand the breadth and depth of the sleep-related data and understand optimal methods of sleep data analysis.

BDC has ingested some of NSRR's data and is working closely with NSRR to continue ingesting more NSRR data regularly. NSRR data are controlled-access data, which means they are available to researchers with eRA Commons IDs and receive data access permissions through the Data Access Request (DAR) process of the NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

## RECOVER 

[RECOVER](https://recovercovid.org/) is a first-of-its-kind, patient-centered research initiative to understand, treat, and prevent Long COVID. RECOVER research includes observational cohort studies, electronic health records analysis, pathobiology studies, and clinical trials.

RECOVER studies involve tens of thousands of people from all walks of life, hundreds of research investigators, and millions of electronic health records (EHRs). RECOVER aims to achieve the following:

-   Understand the range of recovery from Long COVID and the changes it can cause in people over time
-   Define risk factors, understand the number of people getting Long COVID, and determine whether there are specific, different Long COVID types.
-   Study how Long COVID changes over time and how those changes may relate to other illnesses.
-   Identify possible treatments for Long COVID symptoms.

RECOVER Principal investigators and their teams use BDC to analyze scientific data they collect from their research protocols. Once ready for broader availability among researchers, the data are made available in BDC to other authorized researchers.

Currently, BDC hosts a subset of the RECOVER adult cohort study. It has data from over 15,000 participants and their over 107,000 study visits to almost 80 hubs and enrolling sites. Access to this data is limited to investigators who are registered with NIH's Electronic Research Administration (eRA) and agree to abide by data use and sharing limitations.
