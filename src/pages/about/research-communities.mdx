BDC collaborates with many of NHLBI's largest research communities by importing their data, integrating their resources (as appropriate), and providing analytical tools, applications, workflows, and secure workspaces. To support researchers from these communities when they start using the ecosystem, BDC develops and deploys enhancements, tailors the user onboarding process, and encourages participation in the greater BDC community. Researchers within these communities may use BDC to analyze scientific data collected from research protocols.

Once ready for broader availability, investigators with [eRA Commons credentials](https://public.era.nih.gov/commonsplus/public/login.era?TARGET=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.era.nih.gov%3A443%2Fcommons) and approved NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) [data access requests](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) can use BDC to access and analyze data collected by the research communities listed below. Not all the data from these research communities are broadly available in the ecosystem; however, BDC regularly adds data from these communities and other studies for broad research use.

## TOPMed

The first of BDC's research community collaborations was with the [NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/), whose leaders and members provided vital input from BDC's earliest stages to today.

TOPMed is a program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a part of the National Institutes of Health. It aims to improve scientific understanding of the fundamental biological processes that underlie heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders and advance precision medicine in ways that lead to disease treatments tailored to individuals' unique genes and environments.

TOPMed supports scientific advances through the integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other omics data (e.g., metabolic profiles, epigenomics, protein, and RNA expression patterns) with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data from pre-existing parent studies that have large samples of human subjects with rich phenotypic characterization and environmental exposure data. TOPMed also collects environmental and behavioral data, such as dietary habits, physical activity, and socioeconomic factors, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to these disorders.

## RECOVER

[RECOVER](https://recovercovid.org/) is a first-of-its-kind, patient-centered research initiative to understand, diagnose, and treat Long COVID. RECOVER research includes observational cohort studies, electronic health records analyses, pathobiology studies, tissue pathology studies, and clinical trials.

RECOVER studies involve thousands of people from all walks of life, hundreds of research investigators, and millions of electronic health records (EHRs). RECOVER aims to achieve the following:

-   Understand the range of symptoms and impacts on quality of life for individuals experiencing Long COVID.
-   Define risk factors and causes associated with Long COVID.
-   Study how Long COVID changes over time and how those changes may relate to other illnesses.
-   Identify possible treatments for Long COVID symptoms.

## Bench to Bassinet

The [Bench to Bassinet Program](https://benchtobassinet.com/) is a major effort launched by the NHLBI to accelerate scientific discovery to clinical practice by fostering collaborations of basic, translational, and clinical researchers through a flexible program designed to improve outcomes for individuals with congenital heart disease while supporting the needs of the pediatric heart disease research community. Bench to Bassinet advances understanding of how the heart develops and why children are born with heart problems. The information is used to develop new ways to help infants, children, teenagers, and adults born with heart disease. Bench to Bassinet collaborates with BDC by sharing its data in the ecosystem and by offering fellowships to support early-career researchers who leverage its data in BDC.

## BioLINCC

The mission of [BioLINCC](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/) is to facilitate access to and maximize the scientific value of the Biorepository and Data Repository and promote the availability and use of other NHLBI-funded population-based biospecimen and data resources. Study datasets and/or biospecimens from numerous clinical and epidemiological studies are available as Open Period collections.

All BioLINCC data and biospecimen are de-identified (obvious subject identifiers have been redacted); however, they contain such a wealth of individual data that there may be a possibility of determining identity. Therefore, BioLINCC operates under an NIH IRB-reviewed protocol, which requires that datasets may only be released to researchers who are themselves under the oversight of an IRB. In BioLINCC, most of the studies have datasets only; some have both study datasets and biospecimens, and others have biospecimens with limited vial characterization data but not complete study datasets.

BDC has ingested some of BioLINCC's data and is working closely with BioLINCC to continue ingesting more BioLINCC data regularly. BioLINCC data are controlled-access data, which means they are available to researchers who have eRA Commons IDs and received data access permissions through the Data Access Request (DAR) process of the NIH's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).

## C4R

The [Collaborative Cohort of Cohorts for COVID-19 Research, or C4R](https://www.c4r-nih.org/), is a "cohort of cohorts" because it brings together 14 cohort studies with participants from across the U.S. to assess COVID-19 infections, vaccinations, hospitalizations, and pandemic experiences in a coordinated manner. While C4R is one of many efforts investigating the effects of COVID-19, it is unique in that the participants were being followed prior to COVID-19 and have undergone multiple detailed health assessments. The goal of C4R is to improve understanding of what factors increase or decrease the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The cohorts are collaborating so that, together, they can help examine both common and more rare COVID-19 outcomes across a race/ethnicity, age, and geographically diverse population.

## CONNECTS

The NHLBI's [Collaborating Network of Networks for Evaluating COVID-19 and Therapeutic Strategies (CONNECTS)](https://nhlbi-connects.org/) was formed to help prevent infection, slow or halt disease progression, and speed recovery from SARS-CoV-2. The CONNECTS framework includes four therapeutic domains within which clinical trials were conducted: passive immunity, anticoagulation, immunomodulation, and host-tissue targeted therapies.

## Cure Sickle Cell Initiative 

The [Cure Sickle Cell Initiative](https://curesickle.org/) was launched in September 2018 by the NHLBI and aims to transform the lives of individuals living with SCD by moving the most promising genetic therapies safely into clinical trials. This collaborative, patient-focused research effort actively engages the sickle cell disease (SCD) community -- patients, advocates, caregivers, providers, researchers, industry, and others  --  and explores the scientific questions needed to safely and effectively advance potential therapies.

Comparator cohort data are currently available. Gene therapy trial data will be added upon completion, with an estimated availability after 2026.

*Note: Not all sickle cell disease data hosted in BDC are from the Cure Sickle Cell Initiative.*

## HeartShare

[HeartShare](https://amphf.org/) is an NHLBI-funded program to conduct large-scale analysis of phenotypic data, images, and omics from patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and controls to characterize disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets.

HeartShare is comprised of retrospective and prospective components. HeartShare aggregates and harmonizes data from previously completed cohort studies and trials, including images and omics. Prospective data are generated from the HeartShare registry of up to 10,000 participants and deep phenotyping study cohorts involving up to 1,000 participants.  Both cohorts will have baseline and longitudinal data.

## LungMAP

The overall objective of the [LungMAP](https://www.lungmap.net/about-lungmap/lungmap-objectives/)  is to build a comprehensive molecular and cellular atlas of the human lung to serve as a reference platform to better understand both normal biology and disease pathobiology and to identify critical cellular components, molecular pathways, and novel therapeutic targets in lung disease. LungMAP continues generating and integrating high-resolution, multiscale molecular profiles associated with spacial information to provide molecular characterizations of functionally and anatomically defined cell types in the human lung.

## National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) 

[NSRR](https://sleepdata.org/) is an NHLBI-supported repository for sharing large amounts of sleep data (polysomnography, actigraphy, and questionnaire-based) from multiple cohorts, clinical trials, and other data sources. Launched in April 2014, the mission of the NSRR is to advance sleep and circadian science by supporting secondary data analysis, algorithmic development, and signal processing by sharing high-quality datasets. The NSRR encourages active engagement by the sleep and circadian communities, aiming to expand the breadth and depth of the sleep-related data and understand optimal methods of sleep data analysis.

## Pediatric Heart Network

The [Pediatric Heart Network (PHN)](https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/) is a consortium of leading hospitals across the U.S., Canada, and other countries funded by NHLBI to conduct research in children and families living with congenital heart disease or acquired heart disease and adults living with congenital heart disease. Since 2001, the PHN has conducted 29 studies, including 12 clinical trials, with sample sizes ranging from 20-1250 participants.

## PETAL Network

The [Clinical Trials Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network)](https://petalnet.org/index.html) is a network of 12 Clinical Centers (CC) and 1 Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) funded by the NHLBI between 2014 and 2023 to develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials to prevent or treat, and/or improve the outcome of adult patients who have, or who are at risk for, Acute Lung Injury (ALI) or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the PETAL Network directed its efforts to better understand the acute and long-term effects of and find treatments for COVID-19.

## Regenerative Medicine Innovation Project (RMIP)

[RMIP](https://www.nih.gov/rmi)  was established by the [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/cures), a law passed in December 2016, to accelerate medical discovery and innovation by supporting clinical research on adult stem cells while promoting scientific rigor and protecting patient safety. Regenerative medicine includes using stem cells and other technologies---such as engineered biomaterials and gene editing---to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs. Stem cell-based approaches are under development in labs around the world, and some have already moved into clinical trials. RMIP is an NIH-wide effort in coordination with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
