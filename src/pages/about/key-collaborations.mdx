BDC seeks and values collaboration with other programs, projects, and initiatives within NHLBI and NIH, as well as with outside groups. The following are some examples of key BDC collaborations.

## Fellowship Collaborations

From March 2020 through February 2022, the [NHLBI BDC Fellows Program](/about/bdc-fellows) supported the work of over 45 fellows, each of whom advanced their scientific research and provided valuable feedback that informed the development of the ecosystem. Since then, BDC has collaborated with other fellowship programs by offering ecosystem user support and participation in its community of practice.

- The [AIM-AHEAD Research Fellowship](https://www.aim-ahead.net/research-fellowship/) names BDC as a "dataset option" early-career researcher applicants from under-represented populations can use to actively participate in biomedical research that involves the use of artificial intelligence/machine learning methodologies.
- [The Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) & Cardiovascular Development Data Resource Center (CDDRC) Fellows Program](https://benchtobassinet.com/?page_id=2531) was modeled after the BDC Fellowship Program and provides early-career researchers funding to help support research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems in congenital heart disease. Preference is given to proposals that leverage the strengths of the PCGC and/or CDDRC data and BDC to enable cutting-edge computational analyses of genomic and clinical data.
- The [NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Fellowship Program to Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Genomic Data Science Research Workforce notice](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HL-23-086.html) names BDC as a location where researchers can access TOPMed data for the fellowship.

## National Institutes of Health (NIH) Cloud Ecosystem Collaborations

BDC partners with others in the NIH cloud computing domain to help build its community of practice and accelerate progress in the data and biomedical community:

- [NCPI](https://anvilproject.org/ncpi) -- The NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability Effort (NCPI) establishes and implements guidelines and technical standards to empower end-user analyses across participating platforms and facilitate the realization of a trans-NIH, federated data ecosystem. BDC is participating in the NCPI - along with AnVIL, the Cancer Research Data Commons, and the Kids First Data Resource Center - to enable cross-platform data sharing and analysis.
- [STRIDES](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) -- The NIH Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability (STRIDES) Initiative allows NIH to provide cost-effective access to industry-leading partners to help advance biomedical research. These partnerships enable access to rich datasets and advanced computational infrastructure, tools, and services. BDC leverages STRIDES to enhance the efficiency of data storage and computation.
- [ODSS](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-infrastructure) -- The NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) supports efficient and effective biomedical research data infrastructure to achieve NIH's mission of applying knowledge gained through research to improve health. BDC works with ODSS to facilitate secure data storage and broad access to biomedical datasets.
