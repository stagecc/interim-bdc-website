# Explore BDC Data

## About BDC Data

Web visitors can explore the data that BDC hosts without logging in or requesting permission. There 
is also no cost to visitors for exploring BDC-hosted data.

Go to the [Release Notes section of the BDC documentation](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/release-notes) 
to see details about the hosted data in BDC.

## Search Hosted Data
The following buttons link to search capabilities to help investigators discover the data available 
in BDC. Select your search based on the information you have: 


All three of the above searches provide Study Accession IDs. 
The Disease, Phenotype, Biological Process, or Anatomical Entity search also provides Concept and 
Variable Results. 
The Phenotypes or Genomic Variants search provides Study Accession IDs, participant counts, and 
variable distributions.

Go to the BDC documentation to learn more about each of these searches.

## Data from Research Community Collaborators

BDC builds collaborations with research communities that support the ingestion of data from their 
projects into BDC and empower investigators from those communities with innovative analysis tools. 
Learn more about these activities under Research Community Collaborations on the Key Collaborations 
webpage.

To see a list of the datasets hosted in BDC from each of these programs, click on the name of the 
project below:

-   BioLINCC @BDC
-   Cure Sickle Cell Initiative @BDC
-   HeartShare @BDC
-   National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) @BDC
-   RECOVER @BDC
-   TOPMed @BDC

## Requirements for Accessing BDC Hosted Data

Researchers using open-access and/or controlled-access data must have an eRA Commons ID (visit the 
[eRA Commons website for more information](https://www.era.nih.gov/register-accounts/create-and-edit-an-account.htm)) 
because BDC users log into ecosystem platforms using their eRA Commons credentials.

Researchers who wish to use controlled-access data must also have approved data access requests 
(DARs) from the NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) for each dataset. Researchers with 
eRA commons credentials can check their data access approvals:

Researchers who do not have approved DARs for the controlled data should [read the dbGaP section of 
the Understanding Access page in the BDC documentation](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/understanding-access-requirements-for-biodata-catalyst#dbgap) and [Submitting a dbGaP Data Access Request](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/submitting-a-dbgap-data-access-request) 
in BDC's documentation.

Principal Investigators with data access approvals may grant their lab staff access using 
"designated downloader status" in dbGaP. Collaborators from other institutions must obtain their 
own DAR approvals.

## Assess Feasibility

To assess whether BDC's hosted data has enough participants to meet their research criteria (i.e., 
conduct a feasibility assessment), researchers need to do the following:

-   Obtain the Study Accession IDs or know the phenotypes or genomic variants they want to research
-   Confirm they have access to any controlled-access data they want to use

## Build a Cohort

To build a cohort using hosted data, researchers need to complete the same steps as Assessing 
Feasibility and have eRA Commons credentials.
