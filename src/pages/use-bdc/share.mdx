Sharing scientific data accelerates biomedical research discovery by enabling validation of research results, providing accessibility to high-value datasets, and promoting data reuse for future research studies. 

## Instructions and Support for Sharing Data in BDC

NHLBI provides instructions and support to researchers preparing and submitting data to BDC:

Researchers who need additional support for sharing their data in BDC should go to the [Contact Us webpage and select "Data Submission" in the Type field](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact).

## NIH and NHLBI Data Management and Sharing Policies

NIH and its institutes, centers, and offices have several data-sharing policies that researchers must abide by, including the NIH [Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy (effective January 25, 2023)](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview#after), which provides information about [selecting a data repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository). 

The [NHLBI Supplement to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing (effective May 25, 2023)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/nhlbi-policy-for-data-sharing) provides additional information for NHLBI-funded research and research that is ancillary to NHLBI-funded studies. It also encourages submission of data into BDC, "especially for data from studies that must comply with [NHLBI's Accrual of Human Subjects (Milestones) Policy](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/accrual-of-human-subjects-milestones-policy)and for those projects supported by funding opportunity announcements that encourage data deposition into BDC." In addition to the policies, researchers may find it helpful to read [NHLBI's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section on Data Repositories](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/data-sharing-policy-faq-data-repositories).

Researchers who plan to use BDC as their data repository should include "NHLBI BioData Catalyst" in their [data management and sharing plans](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/planning-and-budgeting-for-data-management-and-sharing/writing-a-data-management-and-sharing-plan#after).
