  You can download a list of your selections by clicking the “Download List" button below, return to semantic search to change your choices, or click on one of the three options on the right. 

  All three options on the right require [*eRA Commons account credentials*](https://www.era.nih.gov/register-accounts/understanding-era-commons-accounts.htm). 

  Building a cohort and analyzing data require data access approvals. Researchers who do not have approved DARs for the controlled data they want to use should [read the dbGaP section of the Understanding Access page](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/understanding-access-requirements-for-biodata-catalyst\#dbgap) and [Submitting a dbGaP Data Access Request](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/submitting-a-dbgap-data-access-request) in BDC’s documentation.

  When you select an option on the right, relevant information about your selections will appear on the left, and further instructions will appear on the right.
