  Select an option on the right of the graphic below to see the instructions
  (on the right) and get relevant information (on the left) about that selection.
  Proceeding with any of the three options on the right
  requires [eRA Commons account credentials](https://www.era.nih.gov/register-accounts/understanding-era-commons-accounts.htm). 

  Users must also have approved data access requests for each dataset to Build a
  Cohort Across Datasets for Analysis or Begin Analyzing the Data. Researchers who do not have approved DARs for the controlled data they want to use
  should [read the dbGaP section of the Understanding Access page](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/understanding-access-requirements-for-biodata-catalyst\#dbgap) and [Submitting a dbGaP Data Access Request](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/submitting-a-dbgap-data-access-request) in BDC’s documentation.

  Users can also download their selections by clicking the "Download List" button or return to search to change their choices by selecting "Return to Search."
