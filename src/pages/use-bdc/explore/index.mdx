## About BDC Data

Anyone can explore the data that BDC hosts without logging in or requesting permission. There is also no cost to visitors for exploring data BDC hosts.

To see details about the hosted data in BDC, refer to the [Release Notes](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/release-notes) and [NIH RECOVER Release Notes](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/nih-recover-release-notes) sections of the BDC documentation.

## Search Hosted Data

The following buttons link to search capabilities to discover the data available in BDC. **Select your search based on the information you have:**

<ButtonContainer>
  <Button as="a" href="https://gen3.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/discovery" id="search-gen3" width="33%">Keywords in Study Names or Descriptions</Button>
  <Button as="a" href="/use-bdc/explore-data/dug-results" id="search-dug" width="33%">Disease, Phenotype, Biological Process, or Anatomical Entity</Button>
  <Button as="a" href="https://openpicsure.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/picsureui/" id="search-open" width="33%">Phenotypes</Button>
</ButtonContainer>

> All three of the above searches provide Study Accession IDs - unique, stable, and versioned identifiers. 

> The search capabilities of “Keywords in Study Names or Descriptions” and “Disease, Phenotype, Biological Process, or Anatomical Entity” search across the data dictionaries to explore variables in the studies. 

> The “Disease, Phenotype, Biological Process, or Anatomical Entity” search also returns biomedical concepts and study variables that are related to the search term. 

> The “Phenotypes” search includes participant-level data (aggregate counts returned), variable distributions, data dictionary, and Study Accession IDs.

Refer to the [Explore Available Data](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/explore-available-data) section of the BDC documentation to learn more about each of these searches.

## Assess Feasibility (Optional)

To determine which BDC-hosted dataset(s) meet their research criteria (i.e., conduct a feasibility assessment), researchers can search by various terms, including study names, variables, phenotypes, and even Study Accession IDs (if known). After selecting “Conduct a Feasibility Assessment” below, users can enter their search criteria and then apply filters to retrieve aggregated participant counts.

## Requirements for Accessing BDC Hosted Data

Researchers using open-access and/or controlled-access data must have eRA Commons accounts (visit the [eRA Commons website for more information](https://www.era.nih.gov/register-accounts/create-and-edit-an-account.htm)) because BDC users log into ecosystem platforms using their eRA Commons credentials.

Researchers who wish to use controlled-access datasets must also have approved data access requests (DARs) for each dataset from the [NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/). Researchers can click the "Check Data Access" button below, use their eRA Commons account credentials to log in, click "Yes, I authorize," and check their data access approvals:

  <Button as="a" href="check-data" id="explore-check-data">Check Data Access</Button>
</ButtonContainer>

Researchers who do not have approved DARs for the controlled data they want to use should [read the dbGaP section of the Understanding Access page](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/understanding-access-requirements-for-biodata-catalyst#dbgap) and [Submitting a dbGaP Data Access Request](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/data-access/submitting-a-dbgap-data-access-request) in BDC's documentation.
