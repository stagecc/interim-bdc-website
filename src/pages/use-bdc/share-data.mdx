<PageContent title="Share Data" maxWidth="1000px">

Sharing scientific data accelerates biomedical research discovery by enabling validation of research results, providing accessibility to high-value datasets, and promoting data reuse for future research studies. 

_Note: This page provides information about using BDC as a data repository, which means making data available to individuals who have eRA Commons credentials and who request and receive approved data access requests (DARs) through the [Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/). This is different from research teams collaborating on the analyses of BDC-hosted and/or Bring Your Own Data, which is described on the [Analyze Data webpage](/use-bdc/analyze-data)._

## Instructions and Support for Sharing Data in BDC

NHLBI provides instructions and support to researchers preparing and submitting data to BDC:

Researchers with BDC data-sharing-related inquiries should go to the [Contact Us webpage](/help-and-support/contact-us) and select the "Data Submission" type (dropdown option).

## NIH and NHLBI Data Management and Sharing Policies

NIH &mdash; including its institutes, centers, and offices &mdash; has data-sharing policies that researchers must abide by, including the NIH [Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy (effective January 25, 2023)](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/about-data-management-and-sharing-policies/data-management-and-sharing-policy-overview#after), which provides information about [selecting a data repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository). 

The [NHLBI Supplement to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing (effective May 25, 2023)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/nhlbi-policy-for-data-sharing) provides additional information for NHLBI-funded research and research that is ancillary to NHLBI-funded studies. It also encourages submission of data into BDC, "especially for data from studies that must comply with [NHLBI's Accrual of Human Subjects (Milestones) Policy](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/accrual-of-human-subjects-milestones-policy) and for those projects supported by funding opportunity announcements that encourage data deposition into BDC." In addition to the policies, researchers may find it helpful to read [NHLBI's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section on Data Repositories](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/data-sharing-policy-faq-data-repositories).

Researchers who plan to use BDC as their data repository should include "NHLBI BioData Catalyst" in their [data management and sharing plans](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/planning-and-budgeting-for-data-management-and-sharing/writing-a-data-management-and-sharing-plan#after).
