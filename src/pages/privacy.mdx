## Cookies
The Office of Management and Budget Memo [M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies](https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/misc/m10-22.pdf) allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.

When you visit any Web site, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer. The cookie allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you are connected.

The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. Cookies only collect information about your browser's visit to the site; they do not collect personal information about you.

There are two types of cookies: single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods. The BDC website does not use persistent cookies.


### Session Cookies
We use session cookies for technical purposes, such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1 --- Single Session." The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies."

If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them using your Web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still have access to all information and resources at this site. Instructions for disabling or opting out of cookies in the most popular browsers are located at [https://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.](https://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions) Please note that by following the instructions to opt-out of cookies, you will disable cookies from all sources, not just those from this site.

BDC has links to many other websites, including some sites which are maintained by non-governmental organizations or private companies. BDC is not responsible for the contents of any "off-site" webpage referenced from this server. Specifically:

-   BDC cannot guarantee the privacy or security of information you provide to these other websites. You should review their privacy policies if you have concerns.
